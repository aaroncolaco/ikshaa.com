				<h3>What they say...</h3>

							Sonny Walia, New Delhi, India

						<p>
							I reached Ikshaa with very little expectations as I have experienced in the past that what is normally seen over the internet is very different to the reality. But this beautiful villa was more than what I had hoped for.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ikshaa is one of the most secluded, romantic and luxurious villa I have been to. What is most appealing to it is the fact that it combines luxury with rustic beauty. From the road one can’t even imagine that there lies a 3 bedroom structure. The greenery and forest around was charming. I have to give 10/10 to the landlady, Carmen who designed and built this structure with so much care and love. Small things which eventually make a big difference like sanitation, water supply, water pressures,  lighting, etc were perfect. Everything was well planned.  The bedrooms, the bathrooms and the sitting area, all fantastic.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only company me and my wife had was the monkeys  in the distance and peacocks in our yard (I will ignore the occasional frog in the courtyard).  Peaceful and quiet. The private swimming pool within the villa is ideal for a small family.
						</p>
						<p>
							The villa is super but the structure makes for only a fraction of the story. The luxury and beauty of this place is complimented by the warmth and smile of the friendly landlady, Carmen. She welcomed us and was there throughout, only a call away to take care of all our needs. The housekeeper Anthony deserves a special mention as he with his ever eager and pleasing nature took very good care of us.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now a very important  part.  The  FOOD. It was a gastronomical treat. The best local Goan food I have ever had. Every meal was different and every meal was awesome. Having Carmen's home cooked food in generous helpings is as important as anything else to make a perfect holiday.
						</p>
						<p>
							I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IKSHAA (It’s a AAA place) to anyone who wants a beautiful, quiet, secluded, ROMANTIC and yet LUXURIOUS holiday. And I compliment Carmen on doing such a splendid job.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have found my place in Ikshaa and I hope to return on regular basis.

							You have a gem here, both the property, the peaceful and gorgeous location, plus the most amazing owner and staff score 100% plus for every aspect….I do not usually do “hyperbole” but truly the words fail me for the great care taken by Carmen and her staff, especially Anthony……
						</p>
						<p>
							From the great middle of the night welcome to the stunning accommodation and the truly memorable food, the entire experience at Ikshaa was fabulous.

							Ikshaa! Heaven on Earth!! Is that what it means?! If it is, I wouldn’t be surprised!! I’ve been to Goa a few times but this would be the first time I wanted to stay back at the villa instead of explore!!
						</p>
						<p>
							Carmen has designed the villa with so much of thought and taste! Very  rustic yet stylish.
						</p>
						<p>
							We just loved the food. We especially love the way you take extra care to make something special for every meal. And thank you Anthony! We are yet to meet someone who is as cheerful or as hospitable!
						</p>
						<p>
							Thank you for making our holiday so memorable. Looking forward to coming back over and over!!

							It was nice to get away from the urban sprawl and into the middle of nowhere……”IKSHAA”….Rustic, earthy, serene. Three cheers to Carmen and her team. Add to that, the efficient, warm and ever smiling Anthony…..We couldn’t have asked for more!

							What a beautiful and most serene paradise Ikshaa  is! A home  away from home. I have never relaxed better during my holiday like at Ikshaa.  I have fallen in love with this most charming place and I hope I can return.

							What a beautiful oasis! We fell in love with the place and the hospitality. This is a gorgeously designed villa and we hope to come back soon! Also loved  the frog.  Although we are convinced the monkeys are apprehensive of Americans!!

						<p>
							I had read reviews of Ikshaa online and was really curious about how much it would live up to my expectations!
						</p>
						<p>
							I was rather surprised at this little piece of paradise tucked away in the Loutulim village…..we fell in love with how beautiful the place is and how tastefully it is done up. I personally love the positivity this place is surrounded by , the natural light and breeze.
						</p>
						<p>
							The service provided to us by Anthony was exceptional ! Carmen’s home cooked food is to die for. Ikshaa is my numero uno recommendation if you are a foodie and a nature lover. My stay @Ikshaa compares to no other holiday I’ve spent in Goa.

							I read about Ikshaa whilst researching it for a hotel wishlist for 2012 and decided to end/ begin the year with Ikshaa. Loved everything about it. Most of all, it immediately becomes home and that’s what you look for in a truly restful holiday.

							We had a delightful stay – peaceful, in a very charming and tasteful villa, in the middle of exotic Goan countryside. We felt very welcome and have been very well taken care of by Carmen and Anthony (thanks Anthony for playing and babysitting our little Katja…..she will miss you for sure!). Definitely, a place we recommend for those who want to experience inland Goa, the feel of a village, in a friendly and stress-free environment. Thank you for a great vacation!

							Thank you for the delightful stay in this little place of heaven! We were absolutely and positively surprised to discover such a wonderful , tasteful place in the Goan countryside.
						</p>
						<p>
							The hospitality of Carmen and Anthony was fantastic. We were very lucky to spend New Years Eve in this wonderful place with our entire family. Thank you very much. We will recommend Ikshaa to all our friends in Europe. Very well done!

						<p>
							From the first welcome to our leaving Ikshaa we only encountered warmth and friendship from all at the villa.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ikshaa itself was a fabulously calming and restful retreat from normal life. The facilities were very good and due to the serenity there, it felt as if we were at our own home albeit, a luxurious 5++ star one.
						</p>
						<p>
							We had specific dietary requirements and they were met with no qualms and we were always offered variety. We were offered assistance and advice as and when we needed it.

							Ikshaa villa is an oasis of calm and comfort. The property is finished to an amazingly high standard with many architectural and design motifs. I couldn’t recommend this villa more. The location is both near to the beach and a major town but far away enough for peace and tranquility. Both the owner and the staff were so nice that they are worth a visit alone.

						<p>
							The villa is beautiful, lovely décor and such a peaceful atmosphere. We are so sad to go and will be back for sure. It’s such a lovely village as well, the essence of original Goa, far from the noise and chaos….the perfect escape.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thank you so much for a wonderful fisrt holiday with our son. Ikshaa will always be a little bit extra special for us as it’s where we spent our first holiday as a new bigger family.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thank you Anthony for making our holiday ABSOLUTELY PERFECT in every way…relaxed vibe, gorgeous food every single day! (Do not miss the Pork Solantulem and Chicken Cafreal and Pork Vindalho…and…there's too many to mention!!!) Thanks for everything, Carmen.
						</p>
						<p>
							P.S. We love the chatty frog and the monkeys!!!

							We got gifted this holiday by some dear friends of ours. So when we arrived, everything was a surprise. The place is beautiful in its surroundings and the villa itself is very well thought through and very tastefully done. The colours in the bathrooms were absolutely lovely!
						</p>
						<p>
							Everyday that we were there, it was very calm and soothing. Sitting down and having a cup of tea bythe poolside was just a wonderful experience! We definitely look forward to being back. Carmen was a wonderful host.

							We spent three wonderful days at Ikshaa, the perfect accommodation for our family holiday. Thank you Carmen and Anthony, we felt really welcome and the three dinners we had with Goan specialities and a lot of fish were absolutely delicious! A pity you are so far away from Italy…..but we really hope to come back one day!

						<p>
							Ikshaa is an absolutely fantastic place! We had a truly great holiday from beginning to end.  But even before that, the email contact with Carmen was so nice and friendly that we felt like coming home on the day of our arrival. And then finally see in real what we looked up in the pictures…..wow absolutely breathtaking!
						</p>
						<p>
							All is so great and I didn’t even start talking about the surroundings…..in the midst of a forest, it is an oasis of quietness and stillness. You could just sit there and listen to the noises of nature or watch birds, squirrels and of course the monkeys which we absolutely loved!
						</p>
						<p>
							We could not ask for more, the perfect holiday.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, there is one gem I did not mention yet:  Anthony, you are an absolute star!!! Thank you for everything you’ve done for us. You looked so well after us and there is nothing you could have done more! Again, thank you Carmen and Anthony. May God richly bless you and your families.

							Our first visit to Goa…. and what a truly amazing experience to remember! From the moment we arrived at midnight, both Carmen and Anthony welcomed us with open arms. Anthony and his mother Mary were such a delight to see first thing in the morning and the kids truly adored them. Anthony, your culinary skills in the kitchen are spectacular and we thoroughly enjoyed every meal you cooked for us. Goa has exceeded all of our expectations and we have villa Ikshaa to thank for that. It is a shame to leave but all things must come to an end. Thank you once again and we hope to be back one day to this beautiful state of India.
